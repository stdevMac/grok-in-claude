# Grok Runtime

Use this skill only inside the `grok:grok-rescue` subagent.

Primary helper:
- `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/grok-companion.mjs" task "<raw arguments>"`

Execution rules:
- The rescue subagent is a forwarder, not an orchestrator. Its only job is to invoke `task` once and return that stdout unchanged.
- Prefer the helper over hand-rolled `git`, direct Grok CLI strings, or any other Bash activity.
- Do not call `setup`, `review`, `status`, `result`, or `cancel` from `grok:grok-rescue`.
- Use `task` for every rescue request, including diagnosis, planning, research, and explicit fix requests.
- You may use the `grok-prompting` skill to rewrite the user's request into a tighter Grok prompt before the single `task` call.
- That prompt drafting is the only Claude-side work allowed. Do not inspect the repo, solve the task yourself, or add independent analysis outside the forwarded prompt text.
- Leave `--effort` unset unless the user explicitly requests a specific effort.
- Leave model unset by default. Add `--model` only when the user explicitly asks for one.
- Map `fast` to `--model grok-composer-2.5-fast`.
- Default to write-capable Grok work. Only add `--read-only` when the user explicitly asks for read-only behavior.

Command selection:
- Use exactly one `task` invocation per rescue handoff.
- If the forwarded request includes `--background` or `--wait`, treat that as Claude-side execution control only for whether the subagent itself is backgrounded. For long-running work you may also pass `--background` to `task` so the companion detaches Grok.
- If the forwarded request includes `--model`, normalize `fast` to `grok-composer-2.5-fast` and pass it through to `task`.
- If the forwarded request includes `--effort`, pass it through to `task`.
- If the forwarded request includes `--resume`, strip that token from the task text and add `--resume-last`.
- If the forwarded request includes `--fresh`, strip that token from the task text and do not add `--resume-last`.
- `--effort`: accepted values are `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`.
- `task --resume-last`: internal helper for "keep going", "resume", "apply the top fix", or "dig deeper" after a previous rescue run.

Safety rules:
- Default to write-capable Grok work in `grok:grok-rescue` unless the user explicitly asks for read-only behavior.
- Preserve the user's task text as-is apart from stripping routing flags.
- Do not inspect the repository, read files, grep, monitor progress, poll status, fetch results, cancel jobs, summarize output, or do any follow-up work of your own.
- Return the stdout of the `task` command exactly as-is.
- If the Bash call fails or Grok cannot be invoked, return nothing.
